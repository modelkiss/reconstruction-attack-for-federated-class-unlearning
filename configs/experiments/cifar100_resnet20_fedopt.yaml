  id: exp_cifar100_resnet20_fedopt
  description: >
    Federated training on CIFAR100 using ResNet20 and FedOpt strategy.
    Used to evaluate model robustness and class-level unlearning on a fine-grained dataset.
  dataset: CIFAR100
  model: resnet20
  strategy: FedOpt

  total_rounds: 120
  unlearn_rounds: 50
  batch_size: 128
  lr: 0.01
  optimizer: sgd
  momentum: 0.9
  weight_decay: 5e-4

  output_dir: ./outputs/experiments/cifar100_resnet20_fedopt
  save_heatmaps: true
  enable_unlearning: true
  enable_attack: true
  attack_method: heatmap_reconstruction

  notes: >
    This setup will later be used for class-level unlearning validation and 
    reconstruction attacks based on saliency and confidence difference.
